Legit URL Shortener

Maybe it's using biology4kids.com on your final AP Bio project. Or perhaps it's the url that looks like clicking on it will literally give your computer a viral STD (if that even works). It might even be good old-fashioned "unreliable" Wikipedia, the fountain of knowledge your history teacher obviously has failed to benefit from. Whatever it is, you've probably been told by a teacher that one of the sources on your bibliography has been a poor research material--or you wake up every morning in fear of such an experience. Say goodbye to your woes! LegitLy, a play on the URL Shortener bit.ly, will transform your unreliable Wikipedia article into a seemingly legitimate plain text article nestled deep into the recesses of an ambiguous college website. Try it out.

LegitLy is inspired in concept by bit.ly, shadyurl.com and my former teachers.
