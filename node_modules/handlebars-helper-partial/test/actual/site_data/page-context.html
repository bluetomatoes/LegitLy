    This title is from the PAGE YFM (page-yfm.hbs)

</article>

<p>In this example, the context for <code>title</code> should be from the YAML front matter of <code>partial-yfm.hbs</code>,
but since no <code>description</code> property exists in the YFM of the partial, the context for <code>description</code>
should come from the inheriting page.
