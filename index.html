<p>Hi there! You might be wondering where LegitLy, the URL shortener that made the incredible the credible go. <br> Unfortunately, the owner got tired of Digital Ocean shutting him down due to phishing complaints, and didn't even intend for the site to be actually used. To the +25,000 people that viewed this site, I thank you. It was good while it lasted. <br> If anyone's interested in resuscitating legitly, feel free to email me at matthew [at] llea [.] me. <br> Code is always available on <a href="http://github.com/bluetomatoes/legitly">GitHub</a></p>
