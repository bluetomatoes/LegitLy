<p><!-- test/fixtures/includes/partial-yfm.hbs --></p>
<article id="partial-yfm">
  <div class="title">
    This title is from the PARTIAL YFM (partial-yfm.hbs)
  </div>
  <p class="description"> This description is from the PAGE YFM </p>
</article>

<p>In this example, the context for <code>title</code> should be from the YAML front matter of <code>partial-yfm.hbs</code>,
but since no <code>description</code> property exists in the YFM of the partial, the context for <code>description</code>
should come from the inheriting page.</p>
