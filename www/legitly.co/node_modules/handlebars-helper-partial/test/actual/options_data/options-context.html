  <p class="description"> this description is from the options. </p>

<p>In this example, the context for <code>title</code> should be from the YAML front matter of <code>partial-yfm.hbs</code>,
but since no <code>description</code> property exists in the YFM of the partial, the context for <code>description</code>
should come from the inheriting page.

<article id="partial-yfm">
  <div class="title">
    This title is from the PARTIAL YFM (partial-yfm.hbs)
  </div>
  <p class="description"> this description is from the options. </p>
</article>

<p>In this example, the context for <code>title</code> should be from the YAML front matter of <code>partial-yfm.hbs</code>,
but since no <code>description</code> property exists in the YFM of the partial, the context for <code>description</code>
should come from the inheriting page.</p>
<p>Note that even though we&#39;re explicitly defining <code>page</code> and <code>this</code> as the context, since no data is
defined in the page (e.g. YAML front matter) the context will be set to <code>options.data</code> since
<code>options.data</code> is merged into the context directly after page data.</p>
